**COURSE MEETING TIMES**

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 90 min / session

Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

## **PREREQUISITES**

Students must have completed *8.03 Physics III: Vibrations and Waves* (or [*6.013 Electromagnetics and Applications*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-spring-2009)) and [*18.03 Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011) (or [*18.034 Honors Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-034-honors-differential-equations-spring-2009)) with grades of C or higher.

## **DESCRIPTION**

This course covers the experimental basis of quantum physics. Topics include: photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, photons, Franck-Hertz experiment, the Bohr atom, electron diffraction, de Broglie waves, and the wave-particle duality of matter and light. Introduction to wave mechanics: Schrödinger’s equation, wave functions, wave packets, probability amplitudes, stationary states, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and zero-point energies. Solutions to Schrödinger’s equation in one dimension: transmission and reflection at a barrier, barrier penetration, potential wells, the simple harmonic oscillator. Schrödinger’s equation in three dimensions: central potentials and introduction to hydrogenic systems.

## **WHO SHOULD TAKE 8.04**

This class is a first introduction to quantum mechanics aimed at students with a good grasp of Newtonian mechanics, electricity & magnetism, and waves at the level of *8.01 Physics I*, *8.02 Physics II*, and *8.03 Physics III*. While the topic is not hard, developing an intuition for quantum phenomena demands concerted effort.

## **REQUIRED TEXTS**

There are many good texts on introductory quantum mechanics. Which text is most appropriate for you depends on your interests and goals. To give you some choice, equivalent readings will be assigned each week from each of the following four texts:

Eisberg, Robert M., and Robert Resnick. *Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles*. Wiley, 1985. ISBN: 9780471873730.
